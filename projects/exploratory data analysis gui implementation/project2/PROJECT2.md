# Project 2

 * [PROJECT2](PROJECT2.md) - project 2 description, tasks, and formulation 
 * [README](README.md) - setup and submission

**Goal:** 

The goal of the project is to help students understand the concepts of Java GUI development. Students will replace console-based user interface with a graphical user interface (GUI) for project1 solution (provided as starting point for project2).  You can use  Java 11 native swing framework or JavaFX framework to design the GUI. Baseline code provided in git.txstate.edu/CS3354/projects.git -> project2 folder. 

* All the operations remain the same as provided in instructor's code
* **You CAN modify  all .java files in the starting code of project2 provided.** while keeping the same functionalities. 
* Use only Swing/AWT components and containers **OR** JavaFX components, no mix and match. 
* The user input/output will be handled through Java GUI (swing or JavaFX). 
* The decision regarding which Swing (JavaFX) components should be used to achieve the required functionality is left to YOU! 
   * exemplar code in 2021Spring.git (m4 -> animation, corejava/v1ch11, corejava/v1ch13fx)

## Tasks:

### Task 1 Code Delivery 20 pt

* Submitted project2/*.java files under CS3354/<ID>.git repository - 5pt
* Code compiles and runs, top window displayed - 5 pt
* Javadoc to document the code and design changes - 5pt
* Use of standard Java coding style to improve your programâ€™s visual appearance and make it more readable e.g. https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html - 5pt

## Task 2 Functional GUI 60 pt 

Edit project2 java files so that all user input and output is handled through GUI.  STEPS:
* Edit RatingStatsApp.java so the class is the main user interface - RatingStatsApp class will have to be re-written from scratch. 
* Edit DatasetHandler.java so the class is the main controller class of the program.  DatasetHandler class will not require many changes.
* For use of Swing: Use JTable swing component to visualize a set of Ratings, RatingSummaries, and Report. With the JTable class you can display tables of data (do not allow changes).  
* You have full design freedom. 
* To receive full credit all functionalities need to work correctly using GUI (as they do in the solutuon using commandline).

### Task 3 Design GUI component 20 pt 

* Edit GUI so that new app has a native look and feel using the components - 5 pt
* Native navigation, resizing - 5pt
* User-friendly design, graded on components and visual design choices - 10 pt
